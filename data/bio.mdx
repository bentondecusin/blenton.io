### Welcome to my academic page!

My research primarily focuses on applying causal inference and discovery principles to large-scale database systems, which places my work at the intersection of optimization, theory, systems, and databases.

I received my B.S. and M.Eng. from Cornell University in 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Lorenzo Alvisi](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/lorenzo/) and [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/).

Outside the academic realm, I work in the financial sector.
